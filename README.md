## Overview

**ARCHE** (Autonomous Repository for Conscious Human Engineering) is a user-owned, ethics-governed platform focused on security, transparency, and trauma-informed design.

**EMBER** is ARCHE’s integrated AI defense system—an adaptive firewall, forensic logger, and behavioral audit layer built to detect, block, and report malicious digital activity across systems and services.

---

## Why This Exists

Because most platforms ignore abuse until it’s a headline.  
Because forensic reporting should not require legal degrees or corporate silence.  
Because users have a right to defend themselves—with systems that work.

This repo contains ARCHE + EMBER’s public framework:
- No surveillance.
- No commercialization.
- No exploitation.
