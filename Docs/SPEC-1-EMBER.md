SPEC-1-EMBER

Background

EMBER (Enhanced Monitoring and Behavioral Embedded Response) was born from the necessity of protecting individuals in hostile digital environments where platform accountability is absent. It was designed as part of the ARCHE framework—a sovereignty-first, ethics-driven approach to user security.

Unlike traditional security tools that rely on static rules, post-breach forensics, or platform cooperation, EMBER acts as a platform-agnostic, user-controlled agent. It runs directly on user devices (mobile, desktop, browser), observing behavior, detecting threats, and initiating preemptive countermeasures without requiring any changes to or permissions from the platforms being monitored.

EMBER’s roots lie in real-world experiences of sustained, targeted harassment and system-level abuse, where existing tools failed to protect vulnerable users. It is both a shield (adaptive threat detection and defense) and a witness (forensic-grade, encrypted, user-controlled logging). EMBER gives users the power to anticipate attacks, respond automatically, and retain undeniable records for their own safety, accountability processes, or legal evidence—without surrendering control to third parties.

Method (Part 1 of 2)

High-Level Architecture

EMBER will be designed as a platform-agnostic client agent with a modular architecture:


+----------------------+
|   User Device        |
|                      |
|  +----------------+  |
|  | Ember Agent    |  |
|  |  - Observer    |  |
|  |  - Analyzer    |  |
|  |  - Responder   |  |
|  +----------------+  |
|                      |
|  +----------------+  |
|  | ARCHE Vault    |  |
|  |  - Encrypted   |  |
|  |  - User-owned  |  |
|  +----------------+  |
+----------------------+


Components:
	
1.	Observer
	•	Platform-agnostic listener.
	•	Hooks into network traffic, local API calls, and OS events without needing target app integration.
	•	Monitors tokens, sessions, behavioral patterns.
	2.	Analyzer
	•	AI/ML component modeling normal user/device behavior.
	•	Detects anomalies and precursor events indicating staged attacks.
	•	Includes temporal memory (days/weeks) for pattern escalation.
	3.	Responder
	•	Triggers automated countermeasures:
	•	Session invalidation
	•	Token revocation
	•	Process isolation/sandboxing
	•	Microbans (IP range blocks)
	•	Logs all actions to ARCHE Vault.
	4.	ARCHE Vault
	•	Encrypted, user-controlled datastore.
	•	Stores:
	•	Forensic logs
	•	Credentials
	•	Historical event timelines
	•	Optionally syncs across devices with end-to-end encryption.


Method (Part 2 of 2)

Behavioral Anomaly Detection Algorithm (Pseudocode)


function monitor_event(event):
    profile = load_user_profile()
    anomaly_score = evaluate_anomaly(event, profile)
    if anomaly_score > threshold:
        log_event(event, anomaly_score)
        trigger_response(event)



•	Profile = learned normal user behavior (API calls, tokens used, login times).
	•	Event = observed session refresh, API request, process spawn, etc.
	•	evaluate_anomaly() = statistical / ML scoring (e.g., Isolation Forest, LSTM anomaly scoring).
	•	trigger_response() = mapped defensive action.

⸻

Temporal Feedback Loop
	•	Maintains timeline of detected events over weeks.
	•	Recognizes staged patterns (e.g. phishing ➜ credential ➜ device pairing).
	•	Escalates response severity based on repeated attempts.



Encrypted Log Schema


Detect phishing link ➜ Flag and log
Detect credential use ➜ Invalidate session
Detect device pairing ➜ Block IP + Invalidate all tokens





Field	Type	Description
id	UUID	Unique log ID
timestamp	ISO8601	UTC timestamp
event_type	String	Type of detected event
raw_data	JSON	Observed packet / API call / system event
anomaly_score	Float	Model output
response_action	String	Action taken (invalidate, sandbox, etc.)
device_id	UUID	Local device identifier
user_notes	String	Optional user annotat


All entries:
	•	AES-256 encrypted at rest in the ARCHE Vault.
	•	User-controlled keys (no server dependency required).
